        <td>Swahili is a Bantu language spoken mainly in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, and also in Burundi, 
            Mozambique, Oman, Somalia the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa by about 98 million people. 
            Swahili is an official language of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, and is used as a lingua 
            franca throughout East Africa.</td>
           
        <td>The language known today as Spanish is derived from a dialect of spoken Latin, 
            which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, 
            beginning in 218 BC, and which evolved in 
            central parts of the Iberian Peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century.</td>

        <td>French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. 
            French evolved from Gallo-Romance, the Latin spoken in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. 
            Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France 
            and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) largely supplanted. French was also influenced by 
            native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. 
            Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole. 
            A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.</td>
